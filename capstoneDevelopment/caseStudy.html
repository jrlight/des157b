                <h2>Forming the Idea:</h2>
                <p>
                    It took a while for me to figure out what I wanted to do for my capstone site... looking to the future? That's a bit tough for a burnt-out college student. Among other nebulous topics, in my brain I rotated the idea of "I'm trans, I could do something about being trans."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still, that's vague. Then came my savior... in-class group discussion!
                </p>
                <p>
                    While talking in a group about our capstone ideas, my friend suggested that I could do a site exploring medical transition. A lightbulb went off. Now that's a specific direction, one I want to go in!
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's so much fearmongering around medical transition, especially in the past few years. This website seeks to cut through this fearmongering, to educate in plain language, and link to plenty of sources for further education. It seeks to open people's eyes— whether they're looking to learn more about trans people, are trans themselves, considering being trans, or just want to learn more about natural human variation!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon after finding this direction, I chose to only focus on Hormone Replacement Therapy— no surgeries or other medical procedues. I wanted a narrower topic, so I could give all its parts the attention they deserve in the very limited time I have for this class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project looks to the future by envisioning a world where voluntarily taking "cross-sex" hormones isn't tied up in politics, where hormonal transition is recognized as something embraced by the human body's biology, where people recognize that sex is not binary and that intersex variations are natural.

                <h2>Visual Design Notes:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The site's color scheme is based on the transgender pride flag
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The site is fully responsive from desktop to mobile. This is something very important to me, as smartphones are such a frequent way of browing the web—  I want this, and all my sites, to be accessible to as many people as possible.
                    </li>                    
                    <li>
                        I wanted the site to have an approachable, natural feeling (while not being overly casual)
                        <ul>
                            <li>For the header, I chose Google fonts categorized as "happy." For the body copy, I chose a clean, geometric font.</li>
                            <li>I gave the link "blobs" a bottom-heavy shape, to make them feel fun and give them a sense of natural weight.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Early on, I wanted to have something visually marking pages someone has already visited. This lived on in the accordian menus, which turn from blue to pink once they've been interacted with!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For consistency across pages, I always listed "estrogen" and "testosterone" in alphabetical order.
                        <ul>
                            <li>This unintentionally led to the "estrogen" link blob being blue and the "testosterone" link being pink— opposite of the genders usually associated with those colors. I intentionally kept this as a design element, to make people rethink their color associations.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>                    
                </ul>

                <h2>User interface Notes:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I stuck with a simple, consistent UI throughout the site.</li>
                    <li>Information is revealed through interactive accordion menus
                        <ul>
                            <li>The most pressing feedback I got from the showcase was that it was unclear that the accordian menus were interactive. I had taken out the +/- icon for a previous design of the menu, but in the current design it was sorely needed</li>
                            <li>I added the +/- icons back, and adjusted their color to fit while not drawing <em>too</em> much attention. I also made the blue accordian items turn lighter blue on hover, to highlight the interactivity further.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The page link blobs have a subtle, soft shadow that appears around them when hovered over, and the clickable title links drastically change color when hovered over.</li>
                </ul>
